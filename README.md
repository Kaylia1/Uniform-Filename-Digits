# Uniform-Filename-Digits

DEPENDENCIES:
Python 2 (Python 3 coming soon)


Edit code, change file paths to user specific computer/user preference.

Takes all files within a given folder and sets their length to a certain number of digits.  This is meant to be used with numerically named files.

Filenames longer than given length recieve last letters to acheive given length.  Filenames shorter than given length recieve a "0" at the beginning of the filename until given length is reached.

WARNING: Edits file names, ensure there is no chance of repeated filenames (as that will cause data loss).
